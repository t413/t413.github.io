My site!

It's at [t413.github.io](http://t413.github.io) / [t413.com](http://t413.com).

- Based on the fantastic theme by Matt Swanson [github.com/swanson/lagom](https://github.com/swanson/lagom).
- Uses extraordinary [fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) icons.


###License
Just like Matt I'll use the [MIT license](https://github.com/swanson/lagom/blob/master/LICENSE)
with no added caveats. Use this on your site without attribution or disclaimer.

(but totally star this and [matt's]https://github.com/swanson/lagom) projects!)
